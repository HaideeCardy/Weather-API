# Weather-API

I've found this a big challenge. While I can understand the process behind it and most of what each line of the code is doing. I certainly don't think I am yet able to write my own version of the code. So I have added my API key. Looked at the decriptions on the page and added in some more of the weather information.

I have read up a lot about this area but will continue to look at some JS based tutorials to further my knowledge and experience in this area.

I'm not sure why it isn't working through github but Neel mentioned about trying to 'whitelist' the API to be used through this site but I'm not sure how to do this.
