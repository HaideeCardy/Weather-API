# Weather-API

I've found this a big challenge. While I can understand the process behind it and most of what each line of the code is doing. I certainly don't think I am yet able to write my own version of the code. So I have added my API key. Looked at the decriptions on the page and added in some more of the weather information.

I have read up a lot about this area but will continue to look at some JS based tutorials to further my knowledge and experience in this area.
